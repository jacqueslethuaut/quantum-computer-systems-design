Quantum circuit and Quantum Computer Systems Design are entangled 

Here are some labs to investigate deeply the circuits

Note : in a M2 processor, we need to rebuild tweedledum ... then the .so must be deployed to the python 3.8 environment... it is preferable to use in this specific case the conda python 3.8 environment (tweedledum constraints)
